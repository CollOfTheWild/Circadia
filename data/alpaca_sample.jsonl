LLCs also offer pass-through liability protection: the owners of the LLC are not personally liable for the debts and other risks of the business. \n\nC-corporations, on the other hand, are separate legal entities that are taxed on their own profits. Their shareholders are generally taxed separately on any profits they receive from the C-corporation. C-corporations offer greater flexibility when it comes to issuing stock and issuing dividends to shareholders. They also may be eligible for better tax rates. However, they come with double taxation: the corporation and the shareholders are both taxed on their profits."}]}

Its causes can be traced back to the rivalry between the European colonial powers of France and Germany, and their respective allies. As a result of the war, the German Empire was abolished, and a new set of political arrangements was established in Europe. The aftermath of the war also spurred a massive transformation of global politics, economy, and culture, which continued into the mid-20th century. WWI was the first major war since the introduction of complex machinery and new technologies, such as tanks, machine guns, and chemical warfare. These technologies instigated unprecedented levels of carnage and destruction, leading to the deaths of an estimated 10 million people. WWI also marked the beginning of the modern era of terrorism and political violence, which still has significant implications for global politics today."}]}
